Foreman Audited Notifications
=============================

A simple (but ugly) plugin that sends Audit events via email and lately also
to IRC via [Rbot](http://ruby-rbot.org/).

# Installation:

Add to Gemfile as:

    gem 'audited_notifications', :git => 'https://github.com/frimik/foreman_audited_notifications.git', :branch => 'irc'

# Usage:


Add to your Foreman `config/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
:audit_by_irc:
  :enabled: true
  :address: rbot-server.example.com
  :port: 7272
  :channel: "#theforeman"
  :password: rbot
:audit_by_email:
  :enabled: true
  :recipients:
    - bossman@example.com
```

The IRC notifications require a special UDP listener program that sits between
your rbot and TheForeman. See `extras/rbot-proxy.rb`
